# Enhanced Genetic Algorithm for Book Scanning
# Core dependencies for the enhanced system

# No external dependencies required for core functionality
# The system uses only Python standard library modules:
# - json (configuration management)
# - csv (results tracking)
# - time (timing and timestamps)
# - random (genetic algorithm operations)
# - os (file operations)
# - sys (command line arguments)
# - copy (solution copying)
# - heapq (priority queue operations)

# Optional dependencies for GUI validator (if needed):
# PyQt6>=6.0.0

# Note: The enhanced system is designed to work with Python 3.6+
# using only standard library modules for maximum compatibility
